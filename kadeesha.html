			<p><b>Hi my name is Kadeesha Towers. I was born March 19, 1996 in Chicago, IL. I am the middle child out of 5. I graduated from Foreman High school, a Chicago public school on the North side of Chicago, June 2014. After high school, I became a student at Empire Beauty School where I received my license in cosmetology. I was offered a full –time position at a hair salon, but I was also offered the opportunity to apply for Year Up, which is a one year program that gives urban young adults the access to education, experiences, and guidance required to realize their true potential. I knew I was worth more than just being a hair dresser, so I took the big step of applying to Year Up and now do hair as a side hustle to have money for lunch, transportation, or shopping. During the application process, my mom was diagnosed with cancer which almost caused me to give up on my opportunity at Year Up. I couldn’t let this opportunity go by, so I continued on with it because I knew it would make me a better person and make my mom proud.
As a current student at Year Up, I have changed for the better. I am now more comfortable with speaking to others and I have built relationships and networked with others from various well- known companies. While at Year Up, I have learned hardware, software, and business etiquette skills. Furthermore, I have been awarded a scholarship for the Udacity program, which is a program that teaches foundational skills programmers use whether they program mobile apps, create webpages, or analyze data because I showed my interest in it. I look forward to gaining more knowledge and learning new material during intern. In addition, I look forward to going back to school for computer science and business administration when the time comes. Thanks to Year Up! I now realize that I am worth more than what I was allowing myself to be worth.</b></p>
