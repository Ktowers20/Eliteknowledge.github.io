<p><b>Born and raised in Chicago Illinois to a family of what was four then, to what eventually grew into a family of seven, things were never really easy growing up.  Growing up I lived in the Neighborhood of Pilsen for the first 4 years of my life, and then eventually moved to the Back of the Yards community and have lived there ever since. 
Education was always something that was very important to my family. My parents knew that for us to have successful lives that we would have to have a good education. In saying that I went to Cesar E. Chavez Multicultural Center in Back of the Yards. I went there for my entire K-8 education learning who I wanted to be in life, and figuring out what avenue I wanted my life to go in. It was during one of the high school fairs that my school hosted where I met the high school that I needed to go to be successful, Benito Juarez Community Academy. Once I applied to the school there was a wait period before I got called with the news that I had gotten accepted. I felt very fortunate to have been accepted to the school because of the chance that I would to really lay out my life during high school.
My high school years were nothing of what I expected. I thought that during high school that I wanted to be involved with computers. I was obviously wrong. Coming into my sophomore year there were these new technical education classes that were going to be catering to 4 areas, IT, Nursing, Web Design, and Culinary arts. Thinking that a career in IT is what I wanted to do I apply for the IT technical classes. To my surprising the classes were filled and the only other option there was left was culinary. I hated the first couple of weeks of my culinary class because that wasnâ€™t something that I wanted to do. 
My love for culinary came from a mistake. After a couple of more weeks into this class I learned to love culinary because just like IT, I was working with my hands to solve different puzzles of a meal. Something that I liked to do, and still is something that I like to do.
Thinking that this career was for me I competed for a scholarship to go to culinary school and won the very same.
